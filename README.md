requires ethers.js

## Setup

To use this, you must have a contract already set up on a chain.

You must have a contract abi which can be acquired from the contract's page. 
This is a guideline that tells ethers what methods there are in your contract,
allowing you to call them in JS.

Set up the following parameters for your own contract inside the script:
```
contractabi

provider
contract

myprivatekey
topublickey
value
```

## Usage

node test1.js
